import availableModules from "./availableModules";

// if we haven't even set up singleton mode or community mode, we need to do that first

import "./config";

// get the available modules

// if we're in community mode:
// see if we're missing any modules that we haven't set up yet
// go through the flow of setting up the module

// if we're in singleton mode:
// ask if we want to enable the new modules

// is it possible to check the permissions we have of the OAuth token?
// if we don't have the correct permissions, we shouldn't start up Community Bots until we change the scope

// start each module up




// additional functionality from the terminal
// (all of these functions have already been implemented in config.ts):

// change between singleton and community mode
// enable or disable modules
// change the singleton bot
// add new bots
// change bots of modules

// not implemented:

// join a bot to an additional guild after setup (or rejoin them if they were removed)
