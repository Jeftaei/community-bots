# Community Bots

A collection of bots you can use for a community server.

## Set up the configuration

Setting up the project is a pain in the ass, and it is not recommended that you even try. There won't be documentation to do this.

The next major version is set to be released in 2025. It will provide developer documentation, easy setup and tooling, and better incorporation of concepts for many of the new features Discord has implemented during this version's development.

## Run the project for development

This command will run the project in development mode, and will restart the program if any file changes:

```bash
npm start
```

## Run the project for production

Build the project for the first time

```bash
npm build
```

Now, to run the server, all you have to do is run this command from then on:

```bash
npm server
```
