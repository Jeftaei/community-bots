# Community Bots

A collection of bots you can use for a community server.

## Set up the configuration

Setting up the project is currently a pain in the ass, and it is not recommended that you even try. It is that bad right now.

## Run the project for development

This command will run the project in development mode, and will restart the program if any file changes:

```bash
npm start
```

## Run the project for production

Build the project for the first time

```bash
npm build
```

Now, to run the server, all you have to do is run this command from then on:

```bash
npm server
```
